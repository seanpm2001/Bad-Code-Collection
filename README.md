# Bad code collection

This is my collection for bad code. Code I classify as bad code will be added here when I have time. If there is an example that needs to go here, please raise an issue.

I am currently unsure whether markup languages (such as HTML or Markdown) should count.

## What is bad code?

Bad code is source code that works poorly, uses lots of unnecessary space, or [other reason(s)]. Please note that just because source code may be hard to read/unclean does NOT mean it is bad code. If you are using a thousand lines of code to calculate 2+2, that is DEFINITELY bad code, and you should actually reconsider your career (unless this was done as a joke)

## Questions

### For I: iterate

I have been trying to figure something out for a while now, I finally have a place to talk about it:

The following source code example is functional, and works across various programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Go, etc. (it works under most imperative programming languages that use curly brackets and semicolons)

```c
for (i = 1;
	i < 10;
	i++;
	)
```

However, the programming community seems to loathe this, and I can't figure out why. Is this really bad code?
